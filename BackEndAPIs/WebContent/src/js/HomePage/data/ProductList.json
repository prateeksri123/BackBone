The Optimus Black P970 is powered by a <b>1 GHz Cortex-A8 processor</b> with a <b>PowerVR SGX530 GPU</b> for handling graphic intensive apps. <p>The <b>LG Optimus Black features a Nova IPS Display</b> which LG claims it to be the best ever display they have fitted on a smartphone. The screen packs the same 800 x 480 pixels as that on the LG Optimus 2X, albeit with enhanced brightness, richer contrast ratios and improved sunlight legibility. The <b>5 megapixel camera on the Optimus P970</b> is complimented by a LED flash and can record <b>720p HD video</b>. There is a front facing 2 megapixel camera for video calls.</p> <p>The phone features LG's <b>Optimus 2.0 UI</b> and brings new features like missed calls or new message alerts on your lockscreen. The intelligent lockscreen also takes you to the relevant section as soon as you unlock the screen. Apart from that, the LG Black packs the usual Froyo 2.2 goodies like flash supported browser, Wi-Fi tethering support and wireless control from the notification bar.</p> <p><b>Design</b></p> The Optimus Black wears a <b>sleek, minimalistic chassis</b> and conveys a sense of understated sophistication with its continuous lines. Weighing a frugal 109 g and measuring 9.2 mm in thickness, the Optimus Black is one of the slimmest and most portable mid-high end Android phones in the market. The phone comes with a accelerometer for auto UI orientation, a proximity sensor for auto turn-off and a ambient light sensor for auto brightness adjust. <p>LG has introduced a <b>G button in the Optimus Black P970</b>, once pressed, it allows you to control the phone with various preset motion gestures. The button utilizes the handset's accelerometer to understand the gestures and allows various functions like panning around a web page, changing homescreens or accepting calls without unlocking the screen.</p> <p><b>Battery and Storage</b></p> LG has slimmed down the 1500 mAh battery to fit it into the thin chassis of the Optimus Black. The Lithium Ion cell gives <b>16 hrs of talk time</b> and 455 hrs of standby. The P970 comes with <b>1 GB of internal memory</b> and supports up to 32 GB microSD cards. <p><b>Connectivity and Features</b></p> The Optimus Black can connect to the Internet via 3G, Wi-Fi and GPRS networks.

The media player on the <b>Optimus Black supports Dolby Mobile effect</b> which gives a discernible acoustic improvement when you connect your headphones. <p>The <b>Wi-Fi Direct feature on the LG Optimus Black P970</b> facilitates quick and easy wireless transfers between compatible devices. The best part about the technology is that it does not require a wireless access point Router and works similar to Bluetooth transfers. The Optimus Black features <b>A-GPS connectivity</b> with Digital Compass and syncs with Google Maps. Other features in the P970 include <b>Document Viewer</b>, Push Mail support, Voice commands and Organizer.</p>","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/mobile/h/d/5/lg-optimus-black-p970-400x400-imad4yyvnfn8hcma.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/mobile/h/d/5/lg-optimus-black-p970-275x275-imad4yyvnfn8hcma.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/mobile/h/d/5/lg-optimus-black-p970-75x75-imad4yyvnfn8hcma.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/mobile/h/d/5/lg-optimus-black-p970-125x125-imad4yyvnfn8hcma.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/mobile/h/d/5/lg-optimus-black-p970-40x40-imad4yyvnfn8hcma.jpeg","100x100":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/mobile/h/d/5/lg-optimus-black-p970-100x100-imad4yyvnfn8hcma.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/mobile/h/d/5/lg-optimus-black-p970-200x200-imad4yyvnfn8hcma.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/mobile/h/d/5/lg-optimus-black-p970-original-imad4yyvnfn8hcma.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":23000.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":11890.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/lg-optimus-black-p970/p/itmdv6ev5fgrzy5b?pid=MOBCZKHWQHN2HHD5&affid=mywishlis","productBrand":"LG","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[{"title":"Buy Mobiles along with Power Banks and get 10% off on Power Banks"}],"size":null,"color":"Black Titan","sizeUnit":null,"sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":[{"estimatedDelivery":5,"deliveryTimeUnits":"DAYS","shippingType":"REGULAR"}]},"offset":"v1:tyy-4io:MOBCZKHWQHN2HHD5"},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"MOBCZKHWZFGC4AAP","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Mobiles & Accessories"},{"title":"Mobiles"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"LG T500 Black","productDescription":"The LG T500 is a stylish and elegant touchscreen phone packed with exciting features.

Like the Xperia Neos preceding it, the phone comes in a bar shape.

A 512 MB RAM warrants its ability to smoothly run apps on the phone.</p> <p> The relatively large display is a <strong>4-inch TFT capacitive touchscreen</strong> and provides a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels. The scratch resistant screen provides a level of ruggedness to the device. The UI provided by Sony on the phone is Android&rsquo;s very own <strong>Timescape </strong>which incorporates a degree of simplicity for the user.</p> <p> There are two cameras on the Sony Xperia Neo L. The rear facing camera is a powerful <strong>5 megapixel </strong>device which is accompanied by an LED flash so as to click pictures under minimal lighting. The camera allows the user to <strong>record video in 720p HD</strong> at 30 fps and includes features such as Auto Focus, Touch Focus and Geo-tagging which combine to make the picture-clicking and video-recording experience very enjoyable. The front-facing 0.3 megapixel secondary camera allows the user to carry out video calling easily.</p> <p> <strong>Design</strong></p> <p> When designing this phone, the makers have paid close attention to aesthetics. This is seen in the phone&#39;s dimensions which are 61.1 x 121 x 12.2 mm. With a thickness of 12.2 mm, the device is extremely slender and comfortable to hold. Additionally, the phone weighs in at 131.5 g which makes it quite light in the hand. The Proximity sensor, which prevents the user from tapping unnecessary buttons when held close to the ear and the Ambient Light sensor, which changes the brightness of the display according to the surrounding environment, manage the display effectively.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Storage and Battery</strong></p> <p> The device comes with an internal memory of nominal 301 MB. However, it includes a 2 GB memory card within the device. The memory on the phone can be expanded to up to 32 GB using a micro SD card. The relatively high specifications of this device require an equally capable battery. Hence, the phone is powered by a 1460 mAh Li-Po battery which promises to provide up to <strong>7 hours of talktime</strong> on 2G or 3G networks.</p> <p> <strong>Connectivity and Features</strong></p> <p> The Sony Xperia Neo L is well equipped to keep you connected at home, work or on the move. It comes packed with <strong>GPRS and EDGE technology</strong> for data transfer over the 2G network. The device also comes with HSDPA and HSUPA technology for optimized data transfer over the 3G network. This <strong>Xperia Neo L is WiFi enabled</strong> to let you access the internet from a wireless network. The phone can be tethered to another device using the WiFi hotspot or through the micro USB port. This <strong>Sony Xperia Neo has GPS support </strong>in the form of A-GPS which enhances the ability to locate the user with the help of Google Maps. Files and documents may also be transferred using the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> functionality.</p> <p> The phone promises to keep you entertained with the help of the inbuilt music player. The music experience is further enhanced with xLOUD Audio technology which improves the audio quality of the device. If that doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the user&rsquo;s entertainment needs, the phone comes with a video player as well.</p> <p> Social networking on the Xperia Neo L becomes easier with the <strong>Facebook, Twitter and Skype </strong>apps that are bundled into the device.

outlived their usefulness in being the preferred choice of those who firmly refuse to give in to the smartness of a phone. Samsung launches its Rex series to cater to this need, the Rex 90 is a <strong>dual GSM SIM </strong>bar type phone that runs on Java. The Hybrid Dual SIM gives you uninterrupted data services even when you are on call and the phone also allows you to transfer calls to the other SIM while you are on call.<br /> <br /> The <strong>Samsung Rex 90 S5292</strong> sports a 3.5 inch TFT capacitive HVGA screen with a resolution of 320 x 480 pixels and a color depth of 262k colors. Look at any detail with better detailing with the Rex 90&rsquo;s pinch to zoom feature. The phone comes with the <strong>TouchWiz user interface</strong> that allows you to add and remove screens and customize the dock as well and is designed to add sharpness to your viewing experience.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Never let that funny signboard or the dimpled smile of a friend pass you by without capturing it for posterity. The full touch Rex 90 packs a <strong>3.2 megapixel camera</strong> and is capable of capturing video as well. Forgot to load your music? Be entertained by RJs with the inbuilt FM on the phone that supports recording as well. Music always sounds better with the <strong>3D sound </strong>on the Samsung Rex.</p> <p> <strong>Design</strong></p> <p> Sturdy with a chrome frame, the Samsung Rex 90 has the volume rocker nestled on the left side while the power button fits snugly into the right side. The phone also comes with <strong>3.5 mm audio jack</strong> and responsive keys that make it a breeze to operate the phone even when you are on the move. The rounded body is designed to fit snugly in your palm; the Rex sure is an assertive presence without being obtrusively large.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Storage and Battery</strong></p> <p> The Samsung Rex 90 has an expandable memory which can be extended <strong>up to 32 GB with a microSD card </strong>to store all your media requirements and comes with Hot Swap support as well which allows you to insert or remove the memory card without having to switch off or restart the device. The Rex 90 from Samsung is powered by a <strong>1000 Li-Ion mAh battery</strong> that gives you up to fifteen continuous hours of talk time on a 2G network.</p> <p> <strong>Connectivity and Features</strong></p> <p> The Samsung Rex comes armed with a range of indispensable connectivity options like <strong>EDGE and Wi-Fi </strong>and also supports USB connectivity. The nifty little <strong>bluetooth </strong>feature allows you to share media and documents conveniently with any other compatible phone.</p>","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/z/v/c/samsung-rex-90-s5292r-400x400-imadgce3kutxgfy2.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/z/v/c/samsung-rex-90-s5292r-275x275-imadgce3kutxgfy2.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/z/v/c/samsung-rex-90-s5292r-75x75-imadgce3kutxgfy2.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/z/v/c/samsung-rex-90-s5292r-125x125-imadgce3kutxgfy2.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/z/v/c/samsung-rex-90-s5292r-40x40-imadgce3kutxgfy2.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/z/v/c/samsung-rex-90-s5292r-100x100-imadgce3kutxgfy2.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/z/v/c/samsung-rex-90-s5292r-200x200-imadgce3kutxgfy2.jpeg","unknown":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/z/v/c/samsung-rex-90-s5292r-original-imadgce3kutxgfy2.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":6500.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":5300.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/samsung-rex-90-s5292/p/itmdv6fyxbwr4js2?pid=MOBDGCD6FNS9CZVC&affid=mywishlis","productBrand":"Samsung","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":false,"discountPercentage":0.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[{"title":""}],"size":null,"color":"White","sizeUnit":null,"sizeVariants":"[MOBDGCBGATKPY8MH]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":[{"estimatedDelivery":5,"deliveryTimeUnits":"DAYS","shippingType":"REGULAR"}]},"offset":"v1:tyy-4io:MOBDGCD6FNS9CZVC"},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"MOBDGCD6RDTHWKE9","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Mobiles
